## Step 1 - Required Dependencies

To install and run deemon, you need **Python 3.8 or higher** and the `pip` package manager.

Please refer to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for more information.

On some distributions, the `pip` command is for Python 2. In that case, substitute `pip` for `pip3` in the commands below.

**Windows users**: Run these commands in Command Prompt, Windows Terminal, or PowerShell.

## Step 2 - Installing deemon

This fork is maintained at [mon5termatt/deemon](https://github.com/mon5termatt/deemon). The original upstream project on PyPI is archived and no longer receives updates.

### Install from GitHub (recommended)

Install the latest `main` branch directly with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mon5termatt/deemon.git
```

To install a specific release tag:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mon5termatt/deemon.git@v2.24
```

### Install from a local clone

If you plan to contribute or run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mon5termatt/deemon.git
cd deemon
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

If you prefer not to activate the virtual environment each time, use the repo wrapper:

```bash
./bin/deemon --help
```

You can also symlink it for system-wide use:

```bash
ln -sf "$(pwd)/bin/deemon" /usr/local/bin/deemon
```

## Step 3 - Verify installation

Once installation completes, confirm deemon is available:

```bash
deemon -V
deemon 2.24
```

## Step 4 - Initialize application data

Before first use, initialize the local config and database:

```bash
deemon --init
```

This creates the application data directory used by deemon (config, database, logs).

## Configuration & First Use

Congrats! If you've made it this far, you have successfully installed deemon.
